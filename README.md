This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).


## Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android
Run android emulator or connect physical device, then run command:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn start
# and choose android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# go to ios folder in project and run 
pod install

# then back to the root folder and run:
yarn start
# and choose ios
# possibly you need to launch emulator manually
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see app running in _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
